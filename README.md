> Assignment 3
> > ## Requirement 4: 
> > ### Charting Library
> > Our project uses Chart.js to display data received from the API as bar graphs. We thought this was a 
> > suitable  option for displaying the data since there are multiple sources of funds legislators receive and
> > this allows  users to see both the top sources of political contributions a politician receives and 
> > compare the amounts of  funds received. This allows users to get a more holistic image of the different 
> > factors that may be  influencing the actions and priorities of their legislators. It can also shed light
> > on how they approach  their committee or other special assignments.
> > ### API Data
> > On the user's dashboard, the user is presented with the option to view financial data on their senators 
> > and or their representative. The senators and representative presented here come from the information the
> > user entered when creating their account. The financial data is retrieved from the OpenSecrets API. 
> > Currently, our application uses two of their available data retrieval methods to show the user data on 
> > the top industries and contributors to a congressional member. In addition, we use a news API to gather 
> > recent news on each of  the user's representatives. By combining this information, we aim to give users a
> > more holistic and transparent understanding of the affairs and political assignments their
> > representatives take on as well as  highlight financial dealings users may not have been aware of that 
> > could impact how a member executes their  legislative responsibilities. 


> Assignment 2
> > ## Unit testing: Requirement 4:
> > Our team will write unit tests that will ensure the functionality of our url's and routes.
> > This would also verify that each page is displayed once the action is completed/verified. 
> > Jest offers diverse functionality in testing asynchronous code that would allows us to verify
> > multiple actions that would occur at once. In addition, we will focus on having test cases that ensure 
> > the correct validation of user information. This would be done by implementing jest testing methods
> > that are provided in the documentation. 
> > 
> > As the project begins to incorporate other functionality such as making API calls and storing
> > data in a database. Jest will be a useful tool in ensuring that these functionalities are 
> > performing correctly. The Async and Await tools in jest will offer a great way to test these 
> > operations within our project
