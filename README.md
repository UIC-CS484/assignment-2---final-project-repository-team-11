Requirement 4:
Our team will write unit tests that will ensure the functionality of our url's and routes.
This would also verify that each page is displayed once the action is completed/verified. 
Jest offers diverse functionality in testing asynchronous code that would allows us to verify
multiple actions that would occur at once. In addition, we will focus on having test cases that ensure the 
correct validation of user information. This would be done by implementing jest testing methods
that are provided in the documentation. 

As the project begins to incorporate other functionality such as making API calls and storing
data in a database. Jest will be a useful tool in ensuring that these functionalities are 
performing correctly. The Async and Await tools in jest will offer a great way to test these 
operations within our project
