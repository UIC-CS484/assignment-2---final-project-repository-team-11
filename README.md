## Requirement 4: Charting Library
Our project uses Chart.js to display data received from the API as bar graphs. We thought this was a suitable option for displaying the data since there are multiple sources of funds legislators receive and this allows users to see both the top sources of political contributions a politician receives and compare the amounts of funds received. This allows users to get a more holistic image of the different factors that may be influencing the actions and priorities of their legislators. It can also shed light on how they approach their committee or other special assignments.

> Assignment 2
> > ## Unit testing: Requirement 4:
> > Our team will write unit tests that will ensure the functionality of our url's and routes.
> > This would also verify that each page is displayed once the action is completed/verified. 
> > Jest offers diverse functionality in testing asynchronous code that would allows us to verify
> > multiple actions that would occur at once. In addition, we will focus on having test cases that ensure 
> > the correct validation of user information. This would be done by implementing jest testing methods
> > that are provided in the documentation. 
> > 
> > As the project begins to incorporate other functionality such as making API calls and storing
> > data in a database. Jest will be a useful tool in ensuring that these functionalities are 
> > performing correctly. The Async and Await tools in jest will offer a great way to test these 
> > operations within our project
